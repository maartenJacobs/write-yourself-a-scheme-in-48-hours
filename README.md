# Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours

Repo for my version of [Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

## Improvements

- Tests with HSpec. Always good to have tests, even for a little exercise.
- Cabal sandbox. Useful for running tests and managing dependencies, such as Parsec.
